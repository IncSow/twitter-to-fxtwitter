# TWITTER LINKS TO FXTWITTER

## Requirements
This bot was coded using Ruby 3.1.2
You will need to have your own discord bot token to run this bot.

## Installing steps

Once Ruby 3.1.2 is installed, simply run `bundle install`.
Then, create a .env file containing your token, as such :
`TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`

You can then run this bot using `ruby main.rb`


## More about this bot 
Feel free to contribute, open new issues and PRs.
This was done in an hour for fun, and may or may not evolve as time goes on.

## TO-DO LIST :
Link it to a database, so that each server can choose if they want their messages deleted or not. By default, no messages are deleted right now.
To change this behavior in the meantime, simply uncomment the `deleted` variable.

Add support for Instagram to ddInstagram !

More to come . . .
